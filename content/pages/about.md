I'm a software engineer born in Manchester, England and now living in Johannesburg, South Africa.

After graduating from the University of Pretoria in 2015, I started my career in business analysis. I didn't enjoy it much, learnt to code and never looked back.

You can read about my journey into tech [here](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/taking-the-leap-business-analyst-turns-developer).

I've been fortunate to work for some of the best software development companies in South Africa. I'm recently self employed, spending most of my time building web/mobile applications and doing some consulting in between.

I co-founded Bearing Gifts, a website that aims to help people find great gift ideas for friends and family. You can check it out [here](https://bearinggifts.com.au).

I do most of my engineering in Ruby + Javascript : Typescript. I really dig React & Rails. I'd like to start making time to give back to the open source community soon.
