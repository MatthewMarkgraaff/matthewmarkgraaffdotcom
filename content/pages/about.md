I'm a software engineer born in Manchester, England and now living in Johannesburg, South Africa.

After graduating from the University of Pretoria in 2015, I started my career in business analysis. I didn't enjoy it much, learnt to code and never looked back.

You can read about my journey into tech [here](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/taking-the-leap-business-analyst-turns-developer).

I've been fortunate to work for some of the most innovative companies in South Africa and with some super talented engineers.
Recently self employed, spending most of my time building web & mobile applications for some great clients. I also work on some of my own products/projects.

I co-founded Bearing Gifts, a website that aims to help people find great gift ideas for friends and family. You can check it out [here](https://bearinggifts.com.au).

I write a lot of Ruby + Javascript : Typescript. I enjoy working with React, Node & Rails.

In my down time you'll usually find me in the gym, at a coffee shop, or banging the latest [Foals album](https://www.foals.co.uk/) in my study.
