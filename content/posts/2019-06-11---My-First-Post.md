## I'm new to this. 

I've long admired those who are able to so eloquently and consistently post their thoughts and ideas on their own slice of the internet we've affectionately titled a 'blog'. 

So I'm going to try my hand at writing. I write a lot of code so this should be easy.. Right?

This site will become my scratchpad, a place for me to capture my thoughts on software development, business and whatever other ramblings come to mind. 

I'm stoked to have this space and to have made this first step. I hope you check back soon for future posts.
