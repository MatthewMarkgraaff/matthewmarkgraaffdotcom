2019 was a massive year for me.

I got married to the love of my life, travelled all over Europe on a dream honeymoon, moved into and furnished our new home, visited my family in the USA, resigned from my job, started my self-employment/consulting journey and spent Christmas with my in-laws snowboarding in the French Alps. 

A lot of **stuff** happened. Don't get me wrong, incredible stuff.. It was the best year of my life.

But I have different goals for 2020.

At the start of every new year I, like most,  sit down to reflect on the year that had passed and give thought to the clean slate ahead.

I know I've not yet built an audience but I still see the value in being accountable to myself and making these goals visible.

So here are my plans for 2020.

The measurables:

* Read more. Minimum 1 book a month. It's become clear that reading the right material can be one of the most effective tools for self improvement and it's a habit I will start building into my life.
* Write more. Minimum 1 post a month. Engineering, business, life, politics (kidding).. I plan on writing more this year.
* Be more intentional with music. Pick up guitar again. Get stuck into producing some of my own music.
* Do more. Physical & outdoor activity. Gym volume was great in 2019 but be intentionally diverse with training methods in 2020.
* Ship a product I believe in and that I think solves a real problem. Enjoy the process. Be intentional with design and validate the idea before diving head first into engineering. Learn from past mistakes.
* Grow Bearing Gifts to minimum R10 000 profit per month. 
* Secure my income by moving clients to retainer model, stop always billing based on time. Find a middle ground that is output driven.
* Test more. I dropped the ball with my test coverage last year. I plan on testing my software and investing in my testing toolbelt this year.

The less measurable:

* Strengthen my conversational ability. Listen more than I speak. Learn to formulate responses and pick moments.
* Patience. Learn patience. It's something I've always struggled with.
* Be comfortable being uncomfortable. That means having difficult conversations when perceived to be necessary. Reaching out to potential customers or businesses I'd like to discuss an idea with.

Well there it is. I will edit this post if more comes to mind but there are my goals for 2020. I hope you enjoyed the read and I look forward to assessing my progress at the end of the year.
